# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-pi-
This project implements three MATLAB programs to estimate Ï€ using Monte Carlo simulation. It demonstrates (1) fixed-sample estimation with performance analysis, (2) adaptive precision-based stopping using a while-loop, and (3) an interactive function with live visualization.
